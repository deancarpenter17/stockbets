**Grading Level:**

Same grade for all members.

**Differences:**

- Bet Screen : Didn't include "reasoning" field (not necessary)
- Post Screen : Didn't include user image next to text field (not necessary)
- Added settings screen but only with logout functionality. Full settings were a Final version feature, and will be completed by then.

Run StockBets.xcworkspace instead of .xcodeproj!
